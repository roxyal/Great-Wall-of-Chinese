# Project Scope
This game aims to provide users with an educational gaming experience (with the goal of improving their knowledge in Chinese). Students will be exposed to a range of Chinese topics and answer questions of various difficulty levels. Additionally, students can challenge each other to progress through the leaderboard. This game also aims to facilitate students’ learning progress through generating summary reports, which relieves some responsibilities from teachers to continuously assess the students’ overall mastery of the Chinese language.
